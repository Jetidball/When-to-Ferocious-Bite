# When-to-Ferocious-Bite
When to Ferocious Bite! - Wrath Classic


A Function intended for use with the "WeakAuras" addon.
It meets two conditions:
The first is that "Savage Roar" is an active buff on the player and has longer than 10 seconds remaining
The seoncd is that "Rip" is an active debuff on the target and was cast by the player and also has 10 seconds remaining
When conditions are met a popup reminder of the tooltip will appear on the screen to let the player know it is a safe time to use "Ferocious Bite"
